### 📚 What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of CSS transitions and shadows. Here's an example of how I achieved the hover effect:

```css
.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-15px);
  box-shadow: 
    10px -10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3),
    -10px 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3),
    0 8px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}

I also learned how to maintain rounded corners for both inner and outer borders during hover transitions.

## 🔮 Continued development

I plan to:

- 🖼️ Add support for multiple card designs with different shadow effects.
- 📜 Explore JavaScript integrations for dynamic content rendering.
- ♿ Improve accessibility features.
